  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
    <p><strong>I don't have a bitcoin wallet. Can you recommend one?</strong></p>
    <p>There are many bitcoin wallets available, ranging from paper wallets to android applications. All have specific advantages and disadvantages. For beginners, I recommend the <a href="http://electrum.org">Electrum Bitcoin Wallet</a> since you do not have to download the blockchain and it works on a variety of devices.

    <li>
    <p><strong>I entered my voucher code, but the system does not accept it.</strong></p>
    <p>Please note that there is no "O" (the letter) in the code. The code
    consists of the numbers 0-9 and the letters a-f. If you entered an "O"
    as in Octopus, try a zero as in 007 instead.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><strong>When I redeemed my voucher, there was a link showing the
      transaction in the blockchain. How can I find it
      again?</strong>
    </p> 
    <p>The blockchain is bitcoin's way of tracking who owns what. Since
    the blockchain is public, you can use sites such as <a
      href="http://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a> to observe what
    is happening. When you enter your wallet id on such a site, you can
    see your transaction being processed.  </p> 
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><strong>How much do you make?</strong></p>
    <p>Nothing. After paying for the server, the packaging and the condom
    machine itself I loose money.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><strong>That is sad. Do you accept donations?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, I do. Please send donations to 1MSa5eECnZsuzm4jTVCGbUkGNUXnqpVDjy.<p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <p><strong>This is a neat idea. Can I build one myself?</strong></p>
    <p>Absolutely! You just need a vending machine of some kind. The server
    software is available on github. Have fun!</p>
